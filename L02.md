## Introduction

Aim to exercise understanding of functions, tuples, records, strings

## In the lab

<!--1. Exercises in functions, tuples, records, and strings-->

<!--1. Extending the building control model-->

<!--1. Goat, wolf, cabbage-->

1. Use the `Calculate.tla` specification that you started last week. Modify it
   so that it extends `Integers` and `FiniteSets`, and includes constants
   `R`, `S`, `T`, and `U`. In the `What is the model?` section of the `Model Overview`
   give the following values to `R`, `S`, `T`, and `U`

   ```
   R <- {1, 3}
   S <- {"a", "b"}
   T <- {2, 3}
   U <- {1, 2, 3, 4}
   ```
   Compute the value of the following constant expressions and check your answer
   in the `Evaluate Constant Expression` box of the `Model Checking Results`
   tab:
   1. `[R -> S]` 
   1. `Cardinality([R -> S])`
   1. `[R -> U]`
   1. `Cardinality([R -> U])`
   1. `[R -> SUBSET S]`
   1. `Cardinality([R -> SUBSET S]`)
   1. `Cardinality([R -> SUBSET U]`)
   <!--1. `S \X U`-->
   <!--1. `Cardinality(S \X U)`-->
   <!--1. `R \X S \X T`-->
   <!--1. `R \X (S \X T)`-->
   <!--1. `(R \X S) \X T)`-->
   <!--1. `SUBSET (S \X T)`-->
   <!--1. `Cardinality([R -> SUBSET(S \X T)])`-->

1. Clone the repository at 
   [https://github.com/davidkendall/TLA-Building](https://github.com/davidkendall/TLA-Building).
   Add the specification to the toolbox: `File -> Open Spec -> Add New Spec`,
   browse to the `TLA_Building` directory and open `Building.tla`.

1. Now create a new model: `TLC Model Checker -> New Model`. In the `What is
   the model section?` on the model overview tab, enter values for `PERSON`
   and `BUILDING`, so that the `PERSON` set is `{"p1", "p2", "p3"}` and the
   `BUILDING` set is `{"b1", "b2"}`. Add `TypeOk` as an invariant and run the
   model checker. Look at the error trace. Explain why the model checker finds
   a deadlock.

1. Define an `AddPermission` operation that gives permission to person `p` to
   enter building `b`, as discussed in lecture 2.

1. Define a `DeRegister` operation that removes person `p` from the register

1. Define a `RevokePermission` operation that removes permission from person
   `p` to enter building `b`

1. Update the specification of `Next` to include `AddPermission`, `DeRegister` 
   and `RevokePermission`

1. Specify and check if some properties are invariantly true:
   1. TypeOk
   1. Only people on the register have permissions to be in any building
   1. Any person inside any building has permission
   to be there

   Why are there no deadlocks now?
   

## Homework

1. Work through [sections 15.1 - 15.7 of the hyperbook]({{site.baseurl}}{{site.raurl}}/hyper-tla/math.pdf#section.15).

1. Read sections [3.1-3.2 of the hyperbook]({{site.baseurl}}{{site.raurl}}/hyper-tla/main.pdf#section.3) and watch [Lamport's Die Hard Video](https://lamport.azurewebsites.net/video/video4.html)
   then tackle the problem of the farmer, wolf, sheep and cabbage below.

1. A farmer is on the bank of a river with a wolf, a sheep and a cabbage. He
   wants to cross the river, taking with him the wolf, sheep, and cabbage.
   There is a boat that can fit the farmer plus one of the wolf, the sheep, or
   the cabbage. However, if the wolf and the sheep are ever left on the same
   bank without the farmer, the wolf will eat the sheep. If the sheep and the
   cabbage are ever left on the same bank without the farmer, the sheep will
   eat the cabbage.  How can the farmer safely transport the wolf, the sheep, and the
   cabbage so that all of them are eventually on the other side of the river
   together?
   1. Write a TLA+ specification to model the problem.
   1. State and check a property about the location of the farmer, wolf, sheep 
   and cabbage, which you claim to be invariant, and let TLC
   discover a behaviour in which the property is not invariant.
   1. Use the error trace to extract the behaviour and so propose a
   solution to the problem.

1. Watch [Lamport's Transaction Commit Video](https://lamport.azurewebsites.net/video/video5.html).
