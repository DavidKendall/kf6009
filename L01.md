## Introduction

The purpose of this lab is to introduce you to the [TLA+ Toolbox](https://lamport.azurewebsites.net/tla/toolbox.html).

## In the lab

1. First, check if the toolbox is already installed on your system, e.g.

     ```sh
     $ toolbox &
     ```
   If the toolbox is not installed , download and install the toolbox to your
   system as follows:

     ```sh
     $ cd ~/Downloads
     $ curl -L -O -J https://github.com/tlaplus/tlaplus/releases/download/v1.5.7/TLAToolbox-1.5.7-linux.gtk.x86_64.zip
     $ 
     ```

1. For each of the following formulas, calculate which is a *tautology*.
   Use TLC to check your answer for each one. (Note: if you need a reminder of
   the translation of the ASCII symbols into "standard" notation, look
   at p.6 in the [TLA summary]({{site.baseurl}}{{site.raurl}}/summary.pdf).

     ```
     (F => G) /\ (G => F) <=> (F <=> G)

     (~F /\ ~G) <=> (~F) \/ (~G)

     F => (F => G)

     (F => G) <=> (~G => ~F)

     (F => (G => H)) => ((F => G) => H) 

     (F <=> (G <=> H)) => ((F <=> G) <=> H) 

     (\A x : F /\ G) <=> (\A x : F)  /\ (\A x : G) 

     (\E x : F /\ G) <=> (\E x : F)  /\ (\E x : G) 

     (\A x : F \/ G) <=> (\A x : F)  \/ (\A x : G) 

     (\E x : F \/ G) <=> (\E x : F)  \/ (\E x : G) 
     ``` 

1. Which of the following formulas are valid for all sets S, T, and U? Can you
   TLC to check them? Do the best you can to do so.

     ```
     (S \subseteq T) <=> (S \cup T = T)

     (S \subseteq T) <=> \A x \in S : x \in T

     (S = T) <=> (S \subseteq T) /\ (T \subseteq S)

     (S \subseteq T) <=> (S \ T = {})

     (S \ T) \cup (T \ S) = (S \cup T) \ (S \cap T)

     (S \ (T \cap U)) = (S \ T) \cup (S \ U)
     ```

1. Answer questions 1 to 9 on [this page](http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/lics/tutor/chap1/questions.html).
   Once again, use TLC to check your answers whenever possible.

1. Enter the simple building control model, discussed in the lecture, into the 
   TLA+ toolbox.

1. Change the definition of the `Init` operation as follows

     ```
     Init ==
          /\ register \in SUBSET PERSON 
          /\ in \in SUBSET PERSON 
          /\ out \in SUBSET PERSON 
     ```
   Here `Init` is defined by a *non-deterministic* state predicate, i.e.
   there is more than one state for which this predicate is TRUE.
   What are the possible initial states of this model, given the definition
   of `PERSON`, introduced earlier? Do all of these possible initial states
   satisfy the `TypeOk` specification?

## Homework

1. Install the TLA Toolbox on your own machine

1. Complete the lab exercises

1. Watch the videos from week 1 in the teaching plan on the [module page]({{site.baseurl}})

1. Read chapters 1, 13 and 14 in the [hyperbook]({{site.baseurl}}{{site.raurl}}/start.pdf)
