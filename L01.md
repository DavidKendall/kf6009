## Introduction

The purpose of this lab is to introduce you to the [TLA+ Toolbox](https://lamport.azurewebsites.net/tla/toolbox.html).

## In the lab

1. First, check if the toolbox is already installed on your system, e.g.

     ```sh
     $ toolbox &
     ```
   If the toolbox is not installed , download and install the toolbox to your
   system as follows:

     ```sh
     $ cd ~/Downloads
     $ curl -L -O -J https://github.com/tlaplus/tlaplus/releases/download/v1.5.7/TLAToolbox-1.5.7-linux.gtk.x86_64.zip
     $ mkdir -p ~/.local/packages
     $ unzip TLAToolbox-1.5.7-linux.gtk.x86_64.zip -d ~/.local/packages
     $ cat >~/.local/bin/toolbox <<EOF
export PATH=~/.local/packages/toolbox:\$PATH
toolbox 2>/dev/null &
EOF
     ```
   It should be possible to start the toolbox now. If not, ask your lab tutor
   for help.

     ```sh
     $ toolbox &
     ```
1. In the toolbox, choose `File -> Open Spec -> Add New Spec` and create a 
   new specification called `SimpleBuilding.tla`

1. Enter the simple building control model, discussed in the lecture, into the 
   TLA+ toolbox using the editor window. You can view the full specification
   [here]({{site.baseurl}}{{site.raurl}}/specifications/SimpleBuilding.pdf).
   <br/>**Notes:**
   1. If you need a reminder of
      the translation from "standard" mathematical notation into ASCII symbols, look
      at p.6 in the [TLA summary]({{site.baseurl}}{{site.raurl}}/summary.pdf).
   1. There's no need to enter the comments at this stage - just the formal 
      specification.
   1. Save your specification frequently and fix parsing errors as you go. 

1. When you have a complete, syntactically correct specification, create a new model,
   `TLC Model Checker -> New Model`, called `Model_1`. In the 
   `Model overview` tab, do the following:
   1. Select `Initial predicate and next-state relation`
      as the `behavior spec`
   1. Double click on the `PERSON <-` entry in the `What is the model?` box,
      and enter a value for the `PERSON` constant,
      e.g. `PERSON <- {"alun", "david", "kezhi", "nanlin"}`
   1. Add `TypeOk` as an invariant to check 

   Now run the model checker (click the green button in the toolbar). After running
   for a few seconds, TLC should report `No errors`.
   
1. Formally state, and check, some properties of your specification that you
   expect to be TRUE, e.g.
   1. Everyone on the register is a `PERSON`
   1. Everyone outside the building is a `PERSON`
   1. Everyone inside the building is registered 

1. Formally state, and check some properties of
   your specification that you expect to be FALSE, e.g.
   1. It is not possible for "nanlin" to enter the building
   1. It is not possible for "alun" and "kezhi" to be inside the
      building at the same time
   1. If every `PERSON` is on the register then someone must be outside
      the building
   1. If "david" is registered, then whenever "kezhi" is in the building,
      he must be accompanied by "david"

   Make sure to examine the error trace carefully in each case and understand 
   why these specifications are FALSE.

1. Change the definition of the `Init` operation as follows

     ```
     Init ==
          /\ register \in SUBSET PERSON 
          /\ in \in SUBSET PERSON 
          /\ out \in SUBSET PERSON 
     ```
   Here `Init` is defined by a *non-deterministic* state predicate, i.e.
   there is more than one state for which this predicate is TRUE.
   What are the possible initial states of this model, given the definition
   of `PERSON`, introduced earlier? Do all of these possible initial states
   satisfy the `TypeOk` specification? If yes, explain why. If not, suggest,
   implement, and check a fix.

1. The following exercises are intended to give you some practice in
   applying simple logic and set theory.
   
   For each of the following formulas, calculate which is a *tautology*.
   You should construct a full truth table to check at lease 3 of them
   carefully.

   Create a new specification, `Calculate.tla`, and a new
   model, `Model_1`. Go to the `Model Checking Results` tab and
   use the `Evaluate Constant Expression` box to check your answer for each one. 

     ```
     (F => G) /\ (G => F) <=> (F <=> G)

     (~F /\ ~G) <=> (~F) \/ (~G)

     F => (F => G)

     (F => G) <=> (~G => ~F)

     (F => (G => H)) => ((F => G) => H) 

     (F <=> (G <=> H)) => ((F <=> G) <=> H) 

     (\A x : F /\ G) <=> (\A x : F)  /\ (\A x : G) 

     (\E x : F /\ G) <=> (\E x : F)  /\ (\E x : G) 

     (\A x : F \/ G) <=> (\A x : F)  \/ (\A x : G) 

     (\E x : F \/ G) <=> (\E x : F)  \/ (\E x : G) 
     ``` 

1. Which of the following formulas are valid for all sets S, T, and U? Can you
   TLC to check them? Do the best you can to do so.

     ```
     (S \subseteq T) <=> (S \union T = T)

     (S \subseteq T) <=> \A x \in S : x \in T

     (S = T) <=> (S \subseteq T) /\ (T \subseteq S)

     (S \subseteq T) <=> (S \ T = {})

     (S \ T) \union (T \ S) = (S \union T) \ (S \intersect T)

     (S \ (T \intersect U)) = (S \ T) \union (S \ U)
     ```

1. Answer questions 1 to 9 on [this page](http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/lics/tutor/chap1/questions.html).
   Once again, use TLC to check your answers whenever possible.
